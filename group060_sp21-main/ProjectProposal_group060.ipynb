      "source": "Climate change has been an ongoing issue throughout the world, and it is a topic that has conflicted and divided many groups within society. The subject of climate change has gained popularity over the years as extreme weather conditions have impacted our daily lives and infected the projected use of energy consumption. To us, the severity of this issue pressures us as young adults to scrutinize why there is still a slow improvement towards addressing global warming, and how this may be associated with how individuals tie-in towards the issue. \n\nOur interest in this topic is narrowed down to air quality in the United States. More specifically, how a county’s wealth can work in favor or against air quality. In addition to this, our group wanted to explore the effects of COVID-19 on this issue. It is well known that the pandemic has forced many individuals to work from home, decreasing commuting rates and temporarily shutting off offices, which in turn decreased energy consumption. However, this was not the case for everyone. Jobs that require in person attendance were still being demanded, and in places where there is a lot of manual workforce, the belief is that there is not a lot of wealth found there.\n\nAs a result, this project will inspect how COVID-19 impacted affluent county’s air quality in comparison to less affluent ones. According to the U.S Energy Information Administration, we can already see that CO2 emissions had a decline of nearly 11% in 2020, which can be resulted from the stay-at-home orders and the decrease in transportation rate (1). However, this figure does not illustrate which counties aided this improvement. It is therefore, our aim to provide this information in order to better understand how 2020 had an impact in this issue.\n\nScholars Hai-Ahn H. Dang, Haishan Fu, and Umar Serajuddin have previously conducted research on how GDP growth relates to the environment degradation, but they took a more macro perspective and focused on this relationship across countries. The researchers found out that while '[...] GDP per capita increased by half between 1990 and 2016, global trends for air pollution [...] followed a similar upward trajectory.' (2). However, another study conducted by Guillaume Vandenbroucke and Heting Zhul had findings that indicated  ' Pollution in the United States rises with economic activity, but at a noticeably lower pace.' (3) \n\nWe will conduct this project by correlating each county’s GDP with their locations’ climate analysis pre and post the start of the pandemic. \n\nReferences (include links):\n- 1) 'U.S. Energy Information Administration - EIA - Independent Statistics and Analysis.

In contrast, poorer cities are expected to have maintained a high manual labor workforce that still contributed towards a polluted climate.",
